      <h3>Here's What I Do</h3>
      <p>
        I've been working in healthcare technology and software for the past 10+ years. In addition writing code and supporting customers for a large Electronic Medical Record (EMR) vendor, I've also built software connecting EMR software to a prescription refill software system. Outside of building software, I've also worked as a Product Manager, built websites, managed Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and email marketing software, and consulted for a variety of healthcare technology startups around the country.

      <h3>My Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning more about the healthcare technology space, helping health systems and startups innovate and use technology to improve the lives of both patients and clinical staff. I'm also excited to be learning more software development and using the Ionic framework to build mobile apps or using Javascript for either front-end or server-side applications.
